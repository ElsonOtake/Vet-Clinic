# Vet-Clinic

> The initial data structure for a vet clinic uses a PostgreSQL relational database. Create a table to store animals' information, some data inserted into it, and queries performed.
Update and delete records using transactions and GROUP BY to answer analytical questions.
Use primary & foreign keys mechanisms for joining tables. Query multiple tables.


## Built With

- PostgreSQL


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create database and table.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
